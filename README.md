Abstract
--------

**YYCS** (Yin-Yang Color Scheme) is a simple, effective and flexible
meta color scheme, designed by Dr. Ralf S. Engelschall. It can be used
to generate particular color schemes for use in applications, websites,
diagrams, etc.

**YYCS** supports 2 to 8 base colors as its input and provides 5 to
5x2xN colors (N: number of lighter/darker color spreads) as its output.

**YYCS** is based on the following foundational rules:

1. *Triad Coloring*:
   The color scheme is based on three optical colorings:
   - a primary   "**reg**(ular)" coloring, used about 75% of all times,
   - a secondary "**acc**(ent)"  coloring, used about 20% of all times, and
   - a tertiary  "**sig**(nal)"  coloring, used about 5%  of all times.

2, *Coloring Spread*:
   The color scheme provides for each of the three colorings 1 or an arbitrary
   odd number of pairs of foreground/background colors.

1. *Minimalistic Specification*:
   The color scheme can be unambiguously specified
   with a minimum amount of input information.

3. *Pairing Rule*:
   The color scheme input specification consists of:
   - 2 primary background/foreground color pairs ("reg-bg" / "reg-fg" and "acc-bg" / "acc-fg"),
   - 1 secondary background/foreground color pair ("sig-bg" / "sig-fg"), and
   - 2 tertiary cross-derived foreground colors ("axr-fg" and "sxr-fg")

3. *Spread Rule*:
   the color scheme's 8 base colors
